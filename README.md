# docchain-frontend-user
Secure and simplified form-filling. Store your encrypted documents on decentralised storage and use them to fill forms effortlessly by auto-fetching the documents.

## Problem we solve
Our solution allows users to store their encrypted documents on decentralized storage (IPFS) and then easily access and use them to fill out admission and job-related forms. By connecting to the user's document storage, the system can automatically fetch the required documents, saving the user time and effort. This solution addresses the problem of having to manually locate and upload documents when completing forms, which can be inconvenient and time-consuming. It also provides an added layer of security by keeping the documents encrypted on decentralized storage, ensuring that they are protected from unauthorized access.
